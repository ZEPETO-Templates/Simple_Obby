:wrench: Installation and settings

- If you haven't install the Zepeto World you can check how to do it <a href="https://docs.zepeto.me/studio/reference/installation_and_settings">Here!</a>

- Once you have installed Zepeto, you have to pull this repository and you can do it in 3 ways
  - [Cloning it](#cloning-the-project)
  - [Downloading it](#downloading-the-project)
  - [By Unitypackage](#getting-it-from-the-releases-section)

### Cloning the project
